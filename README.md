# nfq-task-itsvaidas
Task given by NFQ

Firstly I needed a page to work on. I quickly designed the first page (even tho i'm more of a backend person). When all of the pages were done (there are two of them), I moved on with the system.
My Idea was to make everything in index.php file (exluding Objects). I quickly made the .htaccess file to rewrite everything to main page and of course done similar thing to sites-available in apache2. Added https with certbot. 
At first I had trouble imagining how objects could be used on such a small projects, so started with bones of the project and moved from there, adding stuff to make website functional. And then I had a dream arguing with myself about mysql implementation with Objects that I had, and finally came to the sonlution - do everything related with mysql in Project class. One object to get and control everything.
The student asigment part was tricky, because I didn't want to refresh the page every time it was done. So I used a js to php request sending system and updated everything the user can see on screen with javascript. It came together quite nice. 

Didn't do the bonus tasks, because I don't believe my page would pass qualification. I've done that hunderds of times and for something, that I won't qualify, it wouldn't be interesting. The task itself - I had fun creating it and got better understanding on how to implement mysql with objects using php. It was always not my strongest subject, plain PHP and JavaScript is better for me.
